1. `\n` is C notation for the *newline character*.  
2. In C ,all variables must be declared before they are used.  
3. Recommended that writing only one statement per line, and using 
blanks around operators to clarify grouping.  
4. The braces `{ }`position is less important.  
5. `#define` line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be
a particular string of characters.  
6. `putchar()` and `getchar()` are both operators of int data which is 
ascii code.  
7. `EOF` means *end of file* ,whose value si `-1` .  
8. In Clion IDE, I have to change the config file to enter EOF by Ctrl-D.  
9. ***parameter*** is a variable named in the parenthesized list in a function
definition, and ***argument*** is the value used in a call of the function.  
10. ***definition*** refers to the place where the variable is created or assigned storage; 
***declaration*** refers to places where the nature of the variables is stated but no storage is allocated .
11. In C programming, `\0` is the mark of a string. For instance, when a string constant like `"hello\n"` 
. It will be stored as : 

|  h     |  e     | l      | l      |o       |    \n  |  \0    |
|  ----  |  ----  |  ----  |  ----  |  ----  |  ----  |  ----  |  
12. Each local variable in a function comes into existence only when the function is called, and disapears 
when the function is exited.
